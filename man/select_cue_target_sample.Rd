}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing cue–target pairs and FSG values.}

\item{n}{Integer. Number of cue–target pairs to select.}

\item{target_mean_fsg}{Numeric. Desired (approximate) mean FSG for the sample.}

\item{cue_col}{Character. Name of the column containing cue words.
Default is \code{"CUE"}.}

\item{target_col}{Character. Name of the column containing target words.
Default is \code{"TARGET"}.}

\item{fsg_col}{Character. Name of the column containing the forward
strength of association (FSG) values.
Default is \code{"FSG"}.}

\item{cue_min_chars, }{cue_max_chars Integer. Minimum and maximum
allowable cue lengths (in characters). Defaults are \code{1} and \code{Inf}.}

\item{target_min_chars, }{target_max_chars Integer. Minimum and maximum
allowable target lengths (in characters). Defaults are \code{1} and \code{Inf}.}

\item{attempts}{Integer. Number of random draws to attempt in search
of a sample whose mean FSG is closest to \code{target_mean_fsg}.
Default is \code{5000}.}

\item{seed}{Optional integer to set the random seed for reproducibility.}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the selected cue–target pairs and their
FSG values, plus helper columns \code{.cue_nchar} and \code{.tgt_nchar}.
The following attributes are attached:
\itemize{
\item \code{target_mean_fsg}: the user-specified target mean.
\item \code{achieved_mean_fsg}: the sample’s actual mean FSG.
\item \code{mean_abs_diff}: absolute difference between achieved and target means.
\item \code{attempts_used}: total number of search iterations performed.
}
}
\description{
This function samples cue–target pairs (e.g., from the Florida Free
Association Norms) to achieve an approximate target mean forward
strength of association (FSG). The sample contains no duplicate cues
or targets, and only includes pairs whose cue and target fall within
specified character‐length limits.
}
\details{
The function enforces a one-to-one mapping between cues and targets:
each selected pair has a unique cue and a unique target. Sampling is
repeated up to \code{attempts} times; the solution with the smallest
absolute difference between the achieved and target mean FSG is
returned.

Character-length filters are applied before sampling to restrict the
vocabulary to stimuli of appropriate length for presentation or
experimental constraints.
